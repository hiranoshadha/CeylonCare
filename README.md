## 📚 Components Overview

### **Component 01: Machine Learning-Based Disorder Prediction**

**Author:** IT21269370 - Pothuwila P. Y. R

In the modern world, disorders such as diabetes and cholesterol are increasingly common due to unbalanced and unhealthy lifestyles. Early detection and accurate diagnostic methods are crucial for effective management and recovery.
This research introduces a machine learning-based approach to predict the diagnosis status and severity of these disorders based on user-input symptoms. By analyzing patient records, multiple machine learning models—including ensemble techniques—identify patterns and correlations between symptoms and these conditions.

#### Key Features:

- Evaluation of predictive algorithms (decision trees, SVMs, neural networks).
- Development of an ensemble model for enhanced accuracy.
- Implementation as a mobile application for user-friendly interaction.
